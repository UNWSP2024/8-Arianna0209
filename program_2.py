# Program #2: Word Separator
# Write a program that accepts as input a sentence in which all of the words are run together, 
# but the first character of each word is uppercase.  
# Convert the sentence to a string in which the words are separated by spaces, 
# and the first word starts with an uppercase.  
# For example the string "StopAndSmellTheRoses" would be converted to "Stop and smell the roses."
